3D printed parts needed:
 - 1x base
 - 1x top
 - 1x wristrest
 - 10x keyhat_10degrees
 - 10x keyhat_20degrees
 - 3x keyhat_neutral (I personally use non-printed key hats for the thumb section)

base:
  - can be printed in various nozzle sizes, printed mine on 0.6
  - no need for supports

top:
  - can be printed in various nozzle sizes, printed mine on 0.6
  - print upside down (top against the build plate)
  - no need for supports

wristrest:
  - can be printed in various nozzle sizes, printed mine on 0.6
  - smaller nozzle size benefits printing the wire holes for the thumb control cherry MX switches more accurately
  - add support for the bottom most cherry MX switch location from build plate,
    may be OK without depending on your printer (no supports needed elsewhere)

keyhats:
  - print with as small nozzle as possible, 0.4 maximum
  - use supports, add cylindrical support blocker around the cylinder that connects to the key switch (I used 30%-30%-100% scaling in Prusa Slicer)
    otherwise it'll be near impossible to clean the support that gets generated inside the cross

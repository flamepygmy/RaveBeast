This is a custom 3D printed gaming keyboard for left handed use meant for gaming. I use this as my keyboard when playing Destiny 2.

Files included:
   - PCB schematic files that can be used to order PCBs
   - 3D printer files for the parts of the body
   - 3D printer files for custom key caps
   - 3D printing instructions (recommended nozzle diameter, supports, etc.)
   - Source code for the microcontroller (Teensy 4.0)

Extra hardware required:
   - Teensy 4.0 (others may work if they are pin compatible and dimensionally equivalent)
   - 23 key switches that are dimensionally compatible with Cherry MX (I use Cherry MX Red on mine)
   - Micro USB cable (will be used for programming and for running it as a USB keyboard)
   - 4x M3 screws (correct length added here later)
   - 4x M3 heat set inserts (correct dimensions added here later)
   - wiring to connect the 3 thumb controlled keys to the PCB
    
Tools needed:
   - M3 driver
   - solder
   - soldering iron
   - tools for cleaning the 3D prints

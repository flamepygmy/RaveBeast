Open the source code file (keyboard.ino) in Arduino configured with Teensy 4.0 support.

- Plug in the USB cable to the board
- Under Tools->Board menu select "Teensy 4.0"
- Under Tools->USB Type menu select "Keyboard"
- Under Tools->Port select the correct USB port (with Teensy 4.0 if you have only one, if multiple, consider disconnecting other ones during this)
- Press Sketch->Upload

Code will get compiled and uploaded to the Teensy board after which the keyboard is immediately active.

Note: there is a 1 second delay in the beginning of the code to let everything settle before sampling initial state of the pins.
      No keypresses will be processed during this time, recommend not typing anything during this period.
